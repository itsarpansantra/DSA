/*
Given a sorted array of distinct positive integers arr[], You need to find the kth positive number that is missing from the arr[].

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: Missing are 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10… and 5th missing number is 9.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: Missing are 4, 5, 6… and 2nd missing number is 5.
Input: arr[] = [3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Missing are 1, 2, 4, 6… and 2nd missing number is 2.
