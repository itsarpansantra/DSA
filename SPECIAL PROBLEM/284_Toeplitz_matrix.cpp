A Toeplitz matrix (also known as a diagonal-constant matrix) is a matrix in which every descending diagonal from left to right contains the same element.

Given a rectangular matrix mat, determine whether it is a Toeplitz matrix or not.
Implement the function isToeplitz(mat) that returns:

true if the matrix is a Toeplitz matrix
false otherwise
Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[6, 7, 8],
                [4, 6, 7],
                [1, 4, 6]]
Output: true
Explanation: The matrix is Toeplitz because every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements. 
For example, the main diagonal is 6 → 6 → 6, and other diagonals like 7 → 7 and 4 → 4 are also constant. 
Since all diagonals follow this pattern, the matrix is Toeplitz, so the output is true.
Input: mat[][] = [[6, 3, 8],
                [4, 9, 7],
                [1, 4, 6]]
Output: false
Explanation: The primary diagonal elements of the given matrix are [6, 9, 6]. As the diagonal elements are not same, the given matrix is not Toeplitz Matrix.
