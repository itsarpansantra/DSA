/*
You are playing a game with n people standing in a circle, numbered from 1 to n. Starting from person 1, every kth person is eliminated in a circular fashion. The process continues until only one person remains.
Given integers n and k, return the position (1-based index) of the person who will survive.

Examples :

Input: n = 5, k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Firstly, the person at position 2 is killed, then the person at position 4 is killed, then the person at position 1 is killed. 
Finally, the person at position 5 is killed. So the person at position 3 survives. 
Input: n = 7, k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The elimination order is 3 → 6 → 2 → 7 → 5 → 1, and the person at position 4 survives.
